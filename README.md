# FeetBack

A sensory prosthesis neurologic feedback project for the feet.

## Purpose

In this project, sensors and actuators are combined with the purpose of generating feedback.

## How it works

The pressure under the feet is measured, evaluated and output as a vibration on the wrist. The pressure points are visualized in the app and stored as a history in a database.

## Parts

* 2 pressure resistive soles with 12 measure points
* 2 fitness watches with vibrations
* 1 Android smartphone for receiving and sending values between sensors and actors
